This is a fork of phpmark (http://code.google.com/p/phpmark), a
benchmarking tool that tests the performance of a Hello World
application against various PHP frameworks. This fork tests the
Elefant web framework (http://www.elefantcms.com/).

The modifications are as follows:

1. Removed the other frameworks - use the default phpmark to test those
2. Added the latest Elefant source from GitHub (1.3.0)
3. Ran ./conf/elefant build-app hello
4. Added apps/hello/handlers/world.php
5. Edited the README file

Use the included "benchmark.sh" script to run the benchmark.
First, set up a virtual host for the benchmark site, pointing its
document root to the Elefant folder.


Elefant 1.3.0:               /hello/world
