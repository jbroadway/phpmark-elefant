/**
 * A simple access control class for implementing custom permissions in your
 * applications.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   <?php
 *   
 *   // Default usage
 *   $acl = new Acl ();
 *   
 *   if (! $acl->allowed ('resource')) {
 *     // Keep the current user out
 *   }
 *   
 *   // Use an alternate user
 *   $user = new User ($user_id);
 *   
 *   if (! $acl->allowed ('resource', $user)) {
 *     // Keep the user out
 *   }
 *   
 *   ?>
 *
 * The format of the INI file is as follows:
 *
 *   [admin]
 *   
 *   default = On
 *   
 *   [editor]
 *   
 *   default = On
 *   user/admin = Off
 *   myapp = Off
 *   
 *   [member]
 *   
 *   default = Off
 *   user = On
 *
 * The default lines change whether you should allow or deny by default for a
 * given role. The naming convention `user/admin` signifies a feature within an
 * app as opposed to the app itself.
 *
 * Note that Elefant doesn't use Acl in its own features, just `require_admin()`
 * and `require_login()`. This class is intended for custom applications built on
 * top of the framework.
